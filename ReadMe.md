# DIBS (Dedicated in Bulding Support)
DIBS is an on demand marketplace that allows businesses, freelancers and entrepreneurs to list their services and connect with customers. Lets say you are attending an event in an area unfamiliar to you and you need professional photography services, simply go to the app, navigate to the photography category and look for a business signed up. After this point you can view the company portfolio, look at reviews then set an appointment and pay for their services then and there.
